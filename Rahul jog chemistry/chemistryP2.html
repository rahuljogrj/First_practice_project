                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on the time available, it is possible to spread this work over two 1-hour lessons.
                            The
                            first
                            lesson should focus on the chromatography practical with the second lesson recapping the
                            practical
                            and
                            calculating R<sub>f</sub> There are additional worksheets which can be used to supplement
                            the
                            main
                            activities from both lessons. If carried out in one lesson, the first half should focus on
                            the
                            experiment. But as the chromatogram will not dry fast enough to use to calculate Rf values,
                            there
                            should
                            be previously prepared chromatograms for students to use.</li>

                        <li>Ask students to name mixtures of different coloured compounds. (ANS: inks, paints, and food
                            colourings.
                            Explain that chromatography is a technique that can be used to find out which coloured
                            compounds
                            a
                            mixture contains. Explain that in this lesson you will be using ink as the main example as
                            inks
                            often
                            contain a mixture of dyes.</li>

                        <li>Explain that <strong>paper chromatography</strong> works because some compounds dissolve
                            more
                            easily
                            than others in a particular solvent. When the solvent moves up the chromatography paper, it
                            carries
                            the
                            different components in the mixture at different speeds &ndash; so the components become
                            separated.
                            Explain that the chromatography paper is more absorbent but than regular paper, which would
                            not
                            work
                            in
                            the same way.</li>
                        <li>Explain that the paper showing the separated components is known as a
                            <strong>chromatogram</strong>.
                            Show some examples of chromatograms if not used in the starter.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Demo chromatography procedure</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Show how to carry out a chromatography experiment. The <strong>POA Core Content 1</strong>
                            has a
                            <strong>video </strong>and a set of <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong>, as does
                            <strong>Worksheet L7a</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>To test their knowledge of the steps in this experiment, students could complete <strong>POA
                                Activity
                                1</strong>.</li>

                            This practical is one of the core pracaticals required by the specification (1.13). it is
                            supported
                            by the infirmation in <strong>The Student Book( pages 19-20) IG Chemistry Lab Book)</strong>
                            and
                            worksheet L7a which all provide instructions to help students to compare the mixtures of
                            dyes in
                            inks/food colourings. Have a selection of pens available, labelled with letters for ease of
                            identification. These should be tested before the lesson to ensure that they do contain
                            different
                            mixtures of dyes. One set of pens will be sufficient for the whole class. Alternatively
                            bottles
                            of
                            black inks from different manufacturers could be used instead of pens. If using food
                            colourings,
                            try
                            to use darker colours.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Although timing has been given as 30 minutes, the actual experiment will take 10 minutes
                            maximum
                            to set up and depending on technician support it could be even quicker (technicians could be
                            tasked
                            with pre-cutting paper for beaker size, attaching to wooden splints and even applying pencil
                            line
                            and inks to a few chromatography papers as a back-up). Whilst the chromatogram is running,
                            as
                            much
                            as students will enjoy watching the colours separate, it would be a good idea to go onto Rf
                            values
                            (see <strong>Front of class teaching 3</strong>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is a relatively simple procedure, like the chromatography investigations that students
                            will
                            have done during in earlier years. The second side of <strong>Worksheet L7a</strong>
                            contains
                            two
                            separate prompts to
                            help students plan a further investigation. The first suggests investigating the mixtures of
                            dyes in
                            inks other than black or looking at mixtures in 'permanent' inks. Students will need to use
                            solvents
                            other than water for this.
                        </li>

                        <li>The second uses a crime scenario, asking students to test different pens to see if one of
                            them
                            could
                            have been used to write a 'poison pen' letter. Have a selection of four or more pens
                            available,
                            and
                            a pre-prepared chromatogram made from one of them, with the final solvent level marked to
                            allow
                            students to make Rf calculations from it. This is the chromatogram supposedly made using ink
                            extracted from the letter. Also have available a short paragraph of text describing how the
                            chromatogram was made. You could follow this up by discussing whether identifying the type
                            of
                            pen
                            used for writing the letter proves that the suspect from whose home the pen was taken was
                            the
                            writer
                            (no &ndash; because many other people own a similar pen; or the pen could have been left in
                            their
                            home by someone else).
                        </li>
                        <li>The expected results are that darker inks will comprise multiple dyes. The results of the
                            other
                            investigations will depend on the pens available.
                        </li>
                        <li>Alternatively, students could complete <strong>Worksheet L7c</strong> which reinforces the
                            key
                            ideas
                            in this practical. Weaker students should answer question 1 in pairs or small groups. Check
                            their
                            understanding before they start. Other students can work in pairs or small groups to answer
                            question
                            1 and 2 on the worksheet. Question 2 can be made a little harder by removing the word cards
                            from
                            the
                            bottom of the sheet before giving it out. When they have completed the questions, check
                            which
                            students had difficulty with which questions and use the level of the problem to identify
                            any
                            areas
                            for revisiting before moving on to the next topic.

                        <li><u>Support</u>: The further investigation looking at the range of dyes in different coloured
                            pens is
                            the most suitable for students working at this level. Help them to write a simple plan for
                            their
                            investigation, and check that their apparatus is set up correctly to obtain suitable
                            chromatograms.
                        </li>
                        <li><u>Stretch</u>: If doing the &lsquo;Poison Pen&rsquo; activity, some of the pens provided
                            could
                            contain water-soluble inks and some could contain permanent inks &ndash; this will allow
                            rapid
                            elimination of some of them. In addition, students could be provided with several types of
                            chromatography paper, so they will need to find out the type of paper used in the
                            pre-prepared
                            chromatogram and use that type so that they can compare Rf values.
